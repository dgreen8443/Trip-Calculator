# Trip Calculator

## Introduction
A simple calculator to find the easiest payments to ensure that each person on the trip pays their fair share.

## People
In the `people.txt` file, list all people going on the trip with a new line for each.
## Payments 
In the `payments.JSON` file include all of the payments in the format:

```json
"$payment_description" : ["$person_who_paid", $amount_paid]
```
## Calculations
Run `calc.py` and in the terminal the payments needed to balance the trip will be printed.
